# Reign-Mart-E-Commerce
# Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) Challenge: E-commerce Back End

## Description

I had to build backend for an e-commerce website. I used Express.js API and Sequelize the manage and interact with a MySQL database.

the following was the Acceptance Criteria for the assignment.

```
GIVEN a functional Express.js API
WHEN I add my database name, MySQL username, and MySQL password to an environment variable file
THEN I am able to connect to a database using Sequelize
WHEN I enter schema and seed commands
THEN a development database is created and is seeded with test data
WHEN I enter the command to invoke the application
THEN my server is started and the Sequelize models are synced to the MySQL database
WHEN I open API GET routes in Insomnia for categories, products, or tags
THEN the data for each of these routes is displayed in a formatted JSON
WHEN I test API POST, PUT, and DELETE routes in Insomnia
THEN I am able to successfully create, update, and delete data in my database
```
